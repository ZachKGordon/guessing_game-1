The "Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock" Game

The user is prompted for his/her name, and then makes a selection from the available choices ("rock", "paper", "scissors", "lizard", or "Spock").  Depending on the user's selection and a randomly generated selection for the computer opponent, a winner for the match is decided.  Match outcomes are as follows:

Rock crushes scissors or crushes lizard;
Paper covers rock or disproves Spock;
Scissors cuts paper or decapitates lizard;
Lizard eats paper or poisons Spock;
Spock vaporizes rock or smashes scissors

After the match, the user can play again as many times as he/she chooses.  The user is only allowed to provide input from the choices provided; otherwise he/she will be prompted to re-enter his/her input until a valid selection is made.
